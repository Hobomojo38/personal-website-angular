      Hi! My name is Max Zimmermann (<em>see above</em>) and welcome to my blog!
    </p>

      Like many people who find themselves in the position I now am, I’ve wanted
      to start a blog for a while now. While there are many reasons to do so,
      mine stem from a place of curiosity, a want to learn more about the world,
      and a desire to help others in a way I feel I can. See, as the
      overconfident man that I am, I have many thoughts about many things that
      I’d like to talk about, but I find that when actually writing down and
      expressing these thoughts, I struggle to articulate them in a way that
      feels true to my genuine thoughts. This is, in part, due to my poor
      writing skills, but also due to the classic problem inherent to thinking:
      It’s easy to make logical jumps when inside your own head. Everyone
      believes they have some understanding of the world, a comprehensive map
      that connects all the dots in their head, and yet, when they try to
      explain it, it comes out all jumbled, even to them. True understanding of
      a topic takes reflection, and I find that writing helps me to learn more
      about my thoughts. There’s an old saying I like that goes, “If you can’t
      explain it simply, then you don’t know it well enough”. I believe that by
      writing about a topic, you learn about your own understanding of the
      topic.

      Now, that’s why I decided to start writing essays. However, I don’t need a
      blog to do that, right? Correct! In fact, I’ve actually already been
      writing casual essays for the better part of 2 years now on my own. But
      when writing for myself, I find that I often lack the critical lens which
      I need to reflect and learn from my work. I hope that, through publishing
      some of my work, I’ll feel more pressure to examine my work critically and
      improve my writing. I also have a bad tendency to leave projects
      half-finished, and that by having this blog up and running, I can create
      deadlines for myself that incentivise me to write more.

      There is one more reason for starting this site, and it’s, admittedly,
      because of ego. While it’s true that I’m committed to learning more about
      the world, I also believe that I can help others who have gone through
      similar struggles to mine. When I first arrived at my university 4 years
      ago, I was a shell of a person. In the words of my (amazing) therapist, my
      nervous system was in constant fight-or-flight mode and I lived every day
      feeling like I was being held at gunpoint. It took a lot of hard work to
      get where I am today, especially in examining myself and understanding how
      my internal thoughts affect who I am. One such source of these thoughts
      was the idea of masculinity and what it meant to be a man, a platonic
      ideal which my struggle to reach haunted my childhood self. Since then,
      I’ve been passionate about learning how my gender affects who I am, how I
      interact with others, and the shared driving forces behind the male and
      female experiences. I’m far from where I’d like to be in terms of my
      knowledge, not just on gender but everything, but I would still like to
      help those I can with the knowledge I have gained so far. And at worst?
      I’ll have at least tried and learned how to do better in the future.

      That being said, I’m looking forward to filling this page with as much as
      I can. I’m sure if I’m quite really to dedicate the time and effort into
      maintaining consistent uploads, but I’m happy I now have a place to
      publish my work. I often write in response to current events that have
      happened, and if I believe my take is valuable and interesting enough to
      share, I’ll upload it here.

      I’m not sure how long I’ll keep adding new things, but each article I post
      will be one more than I would have if I never tried. I’m sure I’ll look
      back on this site in 2, 5, or 10 years and laugh at who I used to be, who
      I am now. I mean, even I do that with who I used to be, and yet, I’m still
      proud of him. Sure, he was wrong and ignorant most of the time, and he
      made many, <em>many</em> mistakes along the path he walked, but he always
      pushed forward anyways— pushing with the hope that, simply by trying, a
      better future for him was possible. I’m thankful for my past self, and
      I’ll always try and give love to who I used to be, but I’m still growing,
      learning and <em>trying</em> to become the person I’d like to be. And in
      the end, that’s all I can do:
