        "blurb": "<p> I have, undeniably, changed as a person throughout the course of my life. If you were to pick some arbitrary point in my life and compared who I was then with who I am now, you would find a difference, no matter how small, between those two people. However, for as much as I’ve obsessed over my personal growth these past 5 years (and I have obsessed…), I still have a hard time pinning down exactly what this difference <em>is</em>— it’s there, absolutely, but what has actually, <em>really changed</em>? </p> <p> As much as I can see this apparent difference between my past and present self, when intentionally looking for it, I find I struggle to actually <em>feel</em> this difference in my day-to-day life. Because for as much as I have changed as a person, I can feel the person I used to be still living within me. All the fears and anxieties that ruled over past me are still there today, however diminished and regulated, and still dictate my actions like they did in the past. In fact, one of the most significant things I’ve taken away from my therapy sessions is learning to accept that my trauma, and the effects of it on my mind, will always be a part of me. As well, the other parts of me that have changed— my sense of humour, my values, my physical body— all still come from the same source within me as they used to, now just reflected in different ways and through new mediums. Sure, these things have <em>changed</em>, but the ghosts of what they once were still exist somewhere inside of me. So when searching for this mystical <em>difference</em>, where is it to be found? </p>",

        "date": "Aug 10th, 2025",
        "blurb": "<p> In the hundreds of millions of books that have been written, there are very few that shape the world around them. These influential books, such as Karl Marx’s <em>Capital</em> or Ayn Rand’s <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>(while <strong>vastly</strong ><em><strong> </strong></em>different in their messaging), have shaped the culture we live in to the extent their previously monstrous insights almost seem obvious to us today. However, these works have enjoyed the privilege of time, which has allowed them to become part of our collective unconscious— a privilege <em>All About Love </em>has not had. And yet, after reading hooks’ work, it is now impossible not to see it bleeding into the culture we live in. In a world full of pessimism, cynicism, and a feeling of hopelessness against forces greater than ourselves, hooks can just be found, in small pockets we stumble across if our eyes are keen enough to see them. The urging to embrace an unrestricted form of love for our fellow people, the cries for more community, and the wanting to find and give love to the world around us— These videos and articles we watch and read are hooks speaking to us, her ink seeping into the world around us through hopecore edits and unfettered statements of love. <em>All About Love</em> is one of those few books mentioned before, and after reading it, I look forward to seeing a world where it is placed among the very best. </p>",

        "title": "...On Starting a Blog",
        "date": "Aug 2nd, 2025",
        "blurb": "<p> So, how about we start things off right with an introduction: </p> <p> Hi! My name is Max Zimmermann (<em>see above</em>) and welcome to my blog! </p> <p> Like many people who find themselves in the position I now am, I’ve wanted to start a blog for a while now. While there are many reasons to do so, mine stem from a place of curiosity, a want to learn more about the world, and a desire to help others in a way I feel I can. See, as the overconfident man that I am, I have many thoughts about many things that I’d like to talk about, but I find that when actually writing down and expressing these thoughts, I struggle to articulate them in a way that feels true to my genuine thoughts. This is, in part, due to my poor writing skills, but also due to the classic problem inherent to thinking: It’s easy to make logical jumps when inside your own head. Everyone believes they have some understanding of the world, a comprehensive map that connects all the dots in their head, and yet, when they try to explain it, it comes out all jumbled, even to them. True understanding of a topic takes reflection, and I find that writing helps me to learn more about my thoughts. There’s an old saying I like that goes, “If you can’t explain it simply, then you don’t know it well enough”. I believe that by writing about a topic, you learn about your own understanding of the topic. </p>",
