    How’s about we start things off right with an introduction:
  </p>

    Hi! My name is Max Zimmermann (<em>see above</em>) and welcome to my blog!

    Now, you may have some questions, such as “Why are you starting a blog?”,
    “What are you going to write about?”, or “Please, dear God, where did you
    bury them? Please, I’m begging, I just want to have peace.” Unfortunately, I
    don’t have the time to answer all of your burning questions, but I’ll
    respond to the ones I think are most important.

    Why are you starting a blog?
  </h3>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-8003-a537-ced33f26f586" class="">
    The short answer is because I want to. The long answer is that I want to
    improve my writing and encourage myself to write more.

    I’ve actually already been writing blog-style essays for the past couple
    years, they’ve just been inside my Notion and I haven’t really shared them
    with anyone. I enjoy the process of writing these types of articles, as I
    find them to be a good way not just to learn more about a topic but to also
    examine how <em>I think</em> about a topic. A lot of my writing starts with
    me finding a topic that’s trending on social media and just… typing out my
    thoughts. Eventually, I’ll try to find some theme or overall point in my
    thoughts, and in doing so, realize a specific assumption or outlook in which
    I’m viewing the topic. It’s fun!
  </p>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-80cd-b081-f4d39dcc9305" class="">
    As well, I want to start sharing my thoughts on the topics that are
    happening around us. Starting after 2024 US presidential election, I feel
    we’ve now hit a tipping point in culture that I’d like to take a more active
    role in. I’ve always enjoyed talking politics and philosophy with my friends
    (+/- a few drinks…) and I see this as the next step. I’m under no illusions
    of grandeur that this page will be watched as a source of the revolution,
    but I feel an improvement in the quality of my writing when it’s just for
    myself versus writing with the knowledge other people will see my work, and
    that’s enough motivation for me to start this page.

    What will you be writing about?
  </h3>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-8047-83a0-f327e682ae12" class="">
    Mostly politics and philosophy, as those are the things that interest me the
    most and fuel my creativity. I’ve always enjoyed media analysis and breaking
    down the messaging and themes to examine what philosophy they hold at their
    roots, so I’d like to publish some of the examinations I’ve done. As
    mentioned before, I also like exploring about how a niche internet topic can
    tie into much larger themes, so I’d also like to make a few posts about
    those types of topics. However, I’m also aware that my initial kneejerk
    thoughts are usually not worth much, so I’m only planning to post them if I
    see enough insight that I believe I’m <em>adding</em> to the discourse and
    not simply regurgitating talking points I’ve seen online.

    Other than that, it’s really just a free-for-all! If anything, this page is
    a place for me to publish whatever I want and whatever inspires me to write.
    That very well may change into the future, so I’m leaving room for my
    passions and creativity to change as time goes on.

    How did you make this?
  </h3>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-8001-b1ce-ca3b3d519553" class="">
    I know no one’s asking this, but I made it myself from scratch! This is
    quite literally <em>my website</em>, so I’ve taken a few weeks to write the
    code that is now showing you these wonderful words. Now, the technical
    answer is “in the dumbest way possible”: A single-page site using Angular,
    Tailwind, and Vercel hosting services. It is an entirely over-engineered way
    to display possibly the simplest-ever website of static HTML files, but hey,
    the Sistine Chapel didn’t need the windows to go so hard either.
  </p>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-803e-960b-cc2f898b12e5" class="">
    No worries though, I’ve already paid for my folly in that it took my 7 DAYS
    for my webpages to reload correctly.

    How often will you post?
  </h3>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-8084-a576-f12f4c07bcd3" class="">
    I’ll try to publish at least something every month, but I’m still struggling
    to get into the “good enough” mindset that posting requires. I like to
    obsess over my work and constantly try to wring perfection from my brain,
    and I’m trying to break out of that habit so I can actually publish my work
    before I get frustrated by my lack of progress.
  </p>
  <p id="2536324d-6e81-8004-8830-cd9b54c42de1" class="">
    The answer? I don’t know, but I’ll use this page as motivation to wrap
    things up and actually finish my work. There’s a great saying about how the
    best way to make good works is to try and make bad ones. Spending more time
    on a topic you’ve already completed is less valuable than just moving on and
    making a new one; I’m still trying to learn that one (This is my third draft
    of this post)
