    I have, undeniably, changed as a person throughout the course of my life. If
    you were to pick some arbitrary point in my life and compared who I was then
    with who I am now, you would find a difference, no matter how small, between
    those two people. However, for as much as I’ve obsessed over my personal
    growth these past 5 years (and I have obsessed…), I still have a hard time
    pinning down exactly what this difference <em>is</em>— it’s there,
    absolutely, but what has actually, <em>really changed</em>?

    As much as I can see this apparent difference between my past and present
    self, when intentionally looking for it, I find I struggle to actually
    <em>feel</em> this difference in my day-to-day life. Because for as much as
    I have changed as a person, I can feel the person I used to be still living
    within me. All the fears and anxieties that ruled over past me are still
    there today, however diminished and regulated, and still dictate my actions
    like they did in the past. In fact, one of the most significant things I’ve
    taken away from my therapy sessions is learning to accept that my trauma,
    and the effects of it on my mind, will always be a part of me. As well, the
    other parts of me that have changed— my sense of humour, my values, my
    physical body— all still come from the same source within me as they used
    to, now just reflected in different ways and through new mediums. Sure,
    these things have <em>changed</em>, but the ghosts of what they once were
    still exist somewhere inside of me. So when searching for this mystical
    <em>difference</em>, where is it to be found?

    So as I sat thinking about this a few weeks ago while mindlessly scrolling
    through Instagram reels, I noticed a particular quirk in the language that
    was used in videos about personal growth and change— it’s just that: the
    word “growth” being used interchangeably with the word “change”. So, if
    you’ll indulge me here for a bit, I’d like to discuss the difference between
    the words and how, well often used as synonyms in this context, carry very
    different connotations that give us an insight into how we see personal
    development.

    See, when something “changes”, the act of changing means its qualities are
    modified in some way. For example, when you change clothes, you swap your
    previous clothing for a new set, but the being that is “you” remains the
    same otherwise; It is only your attribute of “clothing” that has changed. In
    the classic thought experiment, <em>The Ship of Theseus</em>, we imagine
    changing the parts of a ship— first the sails, then mast, then the deck, the
    hull, the railings, and so on…— and wonder if it’s still the same ship, but,
    importantly, never do we doubt the fact that the Ship is Theseus is still…
    well, a <em>ship</em>. We can change the qualities of the ship as much as we
    want, but in doing so, we crucially never <em>add</em> something that wasn’t
    there before. Doing so would not just be changing the ship, it would cross
    the line into <em>growth</em>.

    When talking of growth, we often think of examples in the realm of nature: a
    tree passing through time does not simply change, it <em>grows</em>. In
    fact, if you were to point at a tree for someone and describe it as changed,
    you might get a funny look in return; Sure, the tree is different than
    before, and thus could be described as “changed”, but removing the idea of
    growth from that process of change feels like removing a core aspect of that
    change. The growth of the tree is tied to its size, and while size is a
    quality of the tree, it more so describes a relationship to the world around
    it and not a part of the tree itself. The materials and qualities the tree
    was comprised of years ago are still there— they haven’t changed. Instead,
    the growth of the tree is the result of <em>adding</em> to the tree. From
    one moment to the next, the tree does not change so much as it becomes
    <em>more</em> than it used to be. This is the concept of growth: growth is
    not becoming different, it is <strong>becoming more</strong><em>.</em>

    For the longest time, I’ve been obsessed with personal growth. I’ve been in
    therapy for many years now, and fact I take a lot of pride in because it’s a
    sign of just how dedicated to my growth I’ve been. I live my life with a
    philosophy that embraces change and allows myself as much room as possible
    to grow, and I like to play the game of wondering, “How much have I
    changed?”. However, for as much time and effort I’ve spent chasing my
    growth, I was so focused on the person I was running towards that I couldn’t
    see the source of my obsession: running away from the person I was, and the
    person that I am.

    Because no matter how much a tree grows, it can never stop being a tree. It
    can become the largest and loudest tree in the woods in the hopes people
    eventually see it as more than a tree, or it can try and shrink until it’s
    the smallest tree in the woods in the hopes that people never see it for the
    tree that it is. However, it can never grow past the fact that is, by virtue
    of being one, a tree. Even if it gets chopped down, stripped, squared, and
    nailed onto the deck of a ship, it is still a tree— only now without its
    leaves, its home, its bark, and its ability to grow. If the tree hates being
    a tree, there is nothing is can do the escape its cruel reality. That is to
    say, I’ve been obsessed with personal growth because, for the longest time,
    I’ve hated who I am.

    It took me a while to realize it, but at some point in my childhood, I
    learned that I wasn’t a good enough person. I may have been smart in my
    classes, but I was never smart <em>enough</em> to really feel valued for it.
    I was strong and fast (important qualities in 5th grade), but my body was
    never <em>enough</em> for me to feel valued for it. I learned I had to earn
    love from the people around me, and yet, no matter how hard I tried, the
    brain and body I was given weren’t enough to earn me that love; And so, I
    started to hate them. In time, that hatred turned towards <em>me</em>, a
    hatred of the person who wasn’t good enough to control his mind and body,
    and I internalized of the fact that I was reason I couldn’t be loved. I
    wanted to be different, to be someone else— someone who was able to be loved
    and was able to earn that love. At one point, I went so far as to consider
    that if I couldn’t be different, than I’d rather just… not be; That was when
    I realized I needed to start talking to a therapist. (Shout out Amy!)

    I’m proud to say that I’ve been improving ever since then! It took a few
    years until I started to feel like a “person”, but every year I’ve lived
    since then has been better than the one before. However, I quickly ran into
    that core issue of growth— I was getting better, sure, but I never changed
    that hatred of myself that lived as the source of my desire for growth. I
    wanted to be <em>different</em>, and yet, no matter how much I grew and
    became more of me, I was always still <em>me</em>. I grew and grew, learning
    and becoming a larger version of myself, but I was just becoming a larger
    version of the thing I hated. There’s a quote from the game
    <em>Undertale</em> that comes back to me when thinking about this: Within
    the first few minutes of playing, you find a mirror that, when interacted
    with, pops up the fun message “It’s you!”. Hours later, when you’ve beaten
    the game a few times and have committed horrible acts within the world,
    changing both it and yourself in the process, you can find the mirror again.
    You, a far cry from the person you once were, look in the mirror and read
    the words, “Despite everything, it’s still you”.

    I’ll never be someone else because people don’t change— they grow; And no
    matter how much I grow, I will never escape the fact that
    <em>I’ll always be me</em>.

    What’s taken me years to learn— and hundreds of stumbles and mistakes in my
    life so far— is that I don’t need to be someone else to not hate myself; I
    can learn to think of myself as a person worthy of the love I so desperately
    crave. The growth I’ve gone through has been good for me and allowed me to
    become more of who I am, but it hasn’t been targeting the root of my
    struggles. Now, I’m learning to accept that my hatred for myself is
    <em>not</em> a part of who I am: it is the result of experiences and lessons
    I learned in my childhood that shaped my way of thinking. I can’t change
    those parts of myself, the parts of me that cause me pain, and while I’ve
    accepted that those will always be a part of me, I know I can try to add
    more parts of myself that counter those toxic memories; I can embrace myself
    and learn lessons of self-love and self-acceptance. I’ll never be able to
    run away from who I am, but I can learn that I’m not someone who needs to be
    run from.

    So, what’s changed between I was and who I am now? The answer is not much. I
    mean, I’ve probably changed my clothes since then, but in term of what’s
    changed about <em>me</em>, everything that used to be there still is. What
    has changed is that I’ve grown to be more than who I was before; I’ve added
    things that have now become parts of myself, and while they can’t change
    what’s already there, my growth can allow me to life the life that I want
    to. You can’t change who you are, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can’t grow
    closer to the person you want to be. Your feelings are a result of all the
    parts of you that you are comprised of, so grow in the direction you’d like
    to feel. It’s not easy, and God knows it’s hard to see where you’re going
    sometimes, but every step you take that is guided by your pursuit of
    self-acceptance is one towards a better life than you have now.

    P.S. Before we say goodbye, I’d like to share one more quote I couldn’t
    quite fit into this post but has also left an impact on my life:
  </p>
  <p id="24d6324d-6e81-8083-bb71-d4fba2605e5d" class="">
    “<em
      >You never step in the same river twice, for it is not the same river, and
      you are not the same person</em
    >”
  </p>
  <p id="24d6324d-6e81-8068-abc2-d5b8ddcd9d77" class="">
    Even when it feels like your pursuit of growth is helpless and you feel back
    in the same spot you were before, I like to remember this quote. Because
    even if it feels like you’ve circled back to where you started, the simple
    act of walking in a circle has changed who you are. You’re never back where
    you were because you’re not the same person as you were before and because
    the river never stops moving.
