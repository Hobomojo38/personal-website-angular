    In the hundreds of millions of books that have been written, there are very
    few that shape the world around them. These influential books, such as Karl
    Marx’s <em>Capital</em> or Ayn Rand’s <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>(while
    <strong>vastly</strong><em><strong> </strong></em>different in their
    messaging), have shaped the culture we live in to the extent their
    previously monstrous insights almost seem obvious to us today. However,
    these works have enjoyed the privilege of time, which has allowed them to
    become part of our collective unconscious— a privilege
    <em>All About Love </em>has not had. And yet, after reading hooks’ work, it
    is now impossible for me not to see it bleeding into the culture we live in.
    In a world full of pessimism, cynicism, and an overwhelming feeling of
    hopelessness against forces greater than ourselves, hooks can just be found,
    in small pockets we stumble across if our eyes are keen enough to see them.
    The urging to embrace an unrestricted form of love for our fellow people,
    the cries for more community, and the wanting to find and give love to the
    world around us— these videos and articles we watch and read carry the voice
    of hooks, speaking to us, her ink seeping into the world around us through
    hopecore edits and unfettered statements of love.
    <em>All About Love</em> deserves to stand next to those few books mentioned
    before, and after reading it, I look forward to seeing a world where it is
    placed among the very best.

    That being said, when I first picked <em>All About Love </em>off the shelf
    of my local bookstore, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect. After finishing
    my previous book, I had decided to read bell hooks next; Knowing that I was
    interested in the topic, I wanted to explore feminist and gender philosophy
    and had appreciated some of the work of hers I had seen before. However, on
    the day when I saw the <em>very</em> limited selection of her work available
    on the shelf, I picked a book that would take me on a much different journey
    than I had originally planned for.

    That’s not to say <em>All About Love </em>is not a feminist book. It quite
    explicitly discusses the topics of patriarchy, gendered socialization, and
    oppression, but these discussions all stem from and support the central
    topic of the book: Love and the importance of combating lovelessness in our
    society.

    Love, as hooks writes, exists as a paradox within our society. She describes
    us living within“…a culture driven by the quest of love (it’s the themes of
    our movies, music, literature) even as it offers so little opportunity for
    us to understand love’s meaning or to know how to realize love in word and
    deed” (pg. xxviii) This paradox, the simultaneous obsession and willful
    blindness to love, is what hooks sees as the main obstacle to solving the
    systemic issues that plague our society. To combat these issues, such as
    sexism and racism, hooks suggests we all must adopt a “love ethic” to be the
    motivating force behind our actions within our communities and society at
    large. By living our lives in pursuit of strengthening love and community,
    hooks says we create a better world where all can prosper. However, to adopt
    a love ethic within our society, we must first adopt it within ourselves; To
    do so, we must first learn what love actually is.

    The reason love is so misunderstood, hooks says, is that we leave the
    responsibility of teaching love solely to the parents of our children.
    Because of this, if your parents fail to properly teach you what love is and
    how to love, whether through neglect or ignorance themselves, throughout
    your childhood, then society gives you very few ways to find the tools to
    teach yourself this all-important skill in adulthood.
    <em>All About Love </em>is hooks’ attempt to compile the lessons and
    knowledge she has collected throughout her life so that others may better
    come to understand love themselves.

    That context, the book being a compilation of hooks’ experiences, is very
    apparent when reading it as, above all else, <em>All About Love</em> is a
    deeply personal work of hooks reflecting on her life. At many points, I
    found myself reading a passage that echoed a statement I’d heard many times
    in therapy or echoed an experience from my past that shaped how I view
    myself today. As someone who has long struggled to reconcile the malignant
    childhood lessons I’ve carried into adulthood, I felt incredibly comforted
    and seen while reading about hooks’ own dysfunctional childhood and the pain
    she still carries from it to this day. At times, the book felt like a
    conversation with an old friend, a conversation that wraps you in the
    comfort of connection and validation. It meets the reader with a kindness
    and illuminates the steps on the path towards understanding love. Even when
    discussion heavy topics such as the patriarchy, hooks consistently extends
    her love and empathy to the individual men she sees upholding the system.
    She does not excuse their actions, often condemning them as moral failings
    onto others, but she still extends them the love she believes is needed for
    them to grow.

    Each chapter of the book details a different step towards love, starting
    with acknowledging and forgiving past wounds in our life, then learning
    about personal love before expanding to the importance of extending our love
    to others. The chapter titled
    <em>Commitment: Let Love be Love in Me </em>is a definitive highlight of the
    book, focusing on how self-love is no different from other loves, requiring
    a commitment to upholding and nurturing your spiritual growth.
    <em>Community: Love Communion </em>is also a highlight as well as a personal
    favourite of mine, pushing back against the notion that love should be
    reserved for only romantic and familial relationships. hooks argues that
    community is a now neglected source and outlet of love in modern life and
    that the promotion of the nuclear family and “rugged individualism” has
    deprived us of incredibly important relationships that are vital to our
    growth and wellbeing. Later, hooks also discusses the unique experiences
    someone will encounter as they live a loving life, such as romance, loss,
    and healing, once again pulling from her own experiences as she moves away
    from speaking as the voice of truth and more as the voice of wisdom, or as
    she would call it, the voice of an angel.

    Spirituality and religion are prominent themes throughout the book, with
    hooks drawing heavy inspiration from her Christian faith in her
    understanding of love. However, even as an atheist and generally
    non-spiritual person, I found her engagement with the divine to still be
    fairly enlightening on the topic of love. Although she cites scripture and
    speaks of God and angels, she utilizes it in a detached way that separates
    the stories and moral lessons from the strong claim to truth religion often
    carries. This extends to her view of spirituality, which she views as the
    world our souls exist within, through which we experience ourselves. For
    hooks, love is the “will to nurtures one’s own or another’s spiritual
    growth”, and this spiritual growth is not simply a connection with oneself
    but a connection with the spiritual world in which your soul, as well as
    everyone else&#x27;s, exists. For me, her view on spirituality and religion
    is most profound in the final chapter during her discussion of angels.
    Angels, hooks says, bare witness to our growth and offer us guidance and
    lessons but, importantly, they are not exclusive to the divine beings we
    often see them depicted as in media and culture. She specifically talks
    about a priest who helped her when she was young, showing her a love and
    kindness she was not used to, and how even though she has not seen him
    since, the gift he gave her allowed her to become who she is today. She
    finishes the book by encouraging us to wholeheartedly accept the gifts
    angels give to us.

    Having now finished <em>All About Love</em>, I can happily state that I’m
    glad to have picked it off the shelf all those weeks ago. It wasn’t the
    philosophical goldmine I was wanting or expecting, but it was exactly the
    profound message I was looking for during a time I needed it the most. I
    don’t doubt that, should you choose to pick it up after reading this, your
    experience will be much different than mine. I’ve struggled with gaining and
    nurturing love my whole life, starting in a childhood that taught me how to
    survive more than it taught me how to live. Since leaving my childhood home,
    I’ve considered myself to be on a journey of self-discovery and self-love,
    and <em>All About Love</em> has been a welcome stepping stone that I
    appreciate for what it is. While I sing of it’s praises now (Quite vocally
    too, I’m sure much to the annoyance of those around me), I know that in a
    few months, I will have a hard time remembering the details that seem so
    important to me right now. However, what I don’t see leaving me anytime soon
    is the message of the book; <em>All About Love</em> is an insistence on the
    importance of affirming love’s place at the centre of our culture and a
    guide on how you can start the journey of learning love. I take comfort in
    knowing that, should I need help through a lull in my journey, the gift of
    an angel is waiting for me, only needing to be picked up off the shelf once
    more.
