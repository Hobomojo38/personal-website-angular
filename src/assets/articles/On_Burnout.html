    Burnout is something I’ve been dealing with my whole life, so the most
    frustrating part of my current mood is the fact I didn’t see it coming. That
    is to say I am, unfortunately and predictably, burnt out. It’s not the first
    time that it’s happened, so while I’m struggling to find the motivation to
    write about anything, I thought I’d simply tell you about my
    <em>past</em> experiences with motivation and a lack thereof.

    As those close to me are <em>well </em>aware of, I am a competitive rower
    for my university team. I first joined the team as part of their novice
    program in September of last year and, despite never having rowed before,
    found myself falling in love with the sport— from the fitness, to the
    team-building and friendship, to the competitive nature of the sport, there
    is a lot of fun to be found in rowing. But with as much potential rowing
    has, it also requires an equal (and sometimes greater) amount of sacrifice
    to support the lifestyle it requires. Waking up at 4:30am requires either
    strict bedtimes or a tolerance for being sleep-deprived most days, and the 2
    hours of daily cardio turns your normal energy levels into a status bar that
    is never quite full. However, despite the total shift in what my life looked
    like, I ran through those first 2 months like I’ve never ran before. It was
    crazy, it was amazing, and most of all, it was one of the best parts of my
    university experience. However, when the calendar hit November, the season
    ended, and we transitioned to off-water training on the ergs, my once
    blooming passion for the sport just… died.

    I’d figured I would need a break after 2 months of non-stop action,
    <em>sure</em>, but once the training started back up, I just… couldn’t bring
    myself to do it anymore. I tried, and even with the later start time of 6am
    (yipee!), I just couldn’t find the motivation that had seemed obvious just a
    month before. The morning practices were still good, don’t get me wrong, but
    it just didn’t feel like the rowing I had come to love. It’s not just that I
    lacked motivation, it was that the lack of motivation came from the loss of
    the <em>passion</em> that had driven me for the season prior. Despite my and
    the coaches best efforts, I just couldn’t train at the level I had before,
    and coming to terms with that was a harsh wakeup call to the reality of what
    it means to be a rower.

    I’ve learned that losing passion for a hobby is no small thing to
    experience. The passion we experience comes from same place as our love— a
    love we give to our hobbies and work with the expectation that we will
    receive very little back besides the enjoyment of giving our love. Love is
    not unique in that way: The love we give to our hobbies is the same love we
    give to people, and when the loss of love occurs in either, it is that same
    grief that strikes us so thoroughly. Because of this sharing of love, we
    experience hobbies much in the same way we do relationships; We will have
    flings with hobbies— I personally had a few dates with Magic: The Gathering
    that ended when I realized she was only interested in me for my money; We’ll
    have longer relationships, too— I grew a bit of a crush on volleyball
    throughout my childhood before finally acting on it in my 2nd year of
    university and we clicked <em>instantly</em>. Our honeymoon lasted about a
    year before life got between us and we found ourselves drifting apart.

    Hobbies, like a person, can change your life when you chose to give them
    unconditional love. The thing standing in way of doing that, in both cases,
    is fear— the fear of losing a love you once held so close. Our culture has
    been keen to make us all aware of the fleetingness of love— we know that in
    a matter of months or even weeks, the connection we share with someone can
    irreconcilably change. This leaves us, as loving people, with a question:
    Why should we give ourselves, our safety, and our love to something that can
    be ripped away from us in an instant? Such is the fear of
    <em>unconditional</em> love, the fear that we will give love to something
    that takes more away from us than it gives back— that we will live out the
    fate of a one-sided lover, one of the oldest villains of sonnets and
    stories.

    Unfortunately, and I do apologize for this, I can’t give you answer we’d
    both like to have. I can tell you that it takes courage and patience, and
    that the answer cannot be found here nor in any other definitive place, but
    instead it is a personal answer, just for your mind and yours alone. What I
    <em>can</em> tell you is why, when I woke up this morning, I still went
    rowing.

    In November of last year, I stopped rowing. I stopped feeling the love from
    the sport I once had, and I decided I needed to take a break because it just
    wasn’t adding to my life. Upon stepping away, I took the time to reconnect
    with myself and the people and activities I’d had to sacrifice for rowing. I
    returned to enjoying my life— staying out late with friends, going to
    theatre rehearsals, enjoying my co-op work, but after a while… I missed it.
    I missed the feeling of biking to the clubhouse half-asleep at 5am on barren
    streets that have yet to wake up; I missed watching the morning sky turn
    from black to orange to a brilliant blue as the sun steadily rose off the
    water around us; I missed the feeling of biking
    <em>back</em> home, past cars driven by people rubbing the sleep out of
    their eyes, and knowing I now had the <em>entire</em> day ahead of me to be
    enjoyed in anyway I saw fit. I missed it all, and I found that, while I was
    still enjoying my life without it, rowing had become a part of the life I
    knew I wanted to have. The only problem was… the rowing I knew was gone.

    It was winter now, and my view of the morning sunrises on the water had
    turned into a beige brick wall in a cramped and damp hallway. The rowing I
    loved was gone, but while I knew that I couldn’t change what rowing had to
    offer me, I decided that rowing had earned some love from me— even if I
    didn’t get much back from my efforts, I knew that the simple act of
    <em>giving</em> <em>love</em> to the sport I’d come to care for was worth my
    time. And so, I approached each day after that like it could have been my
    last one and gave enough love to know I could leave satisfied if I never saw
    the sport again. I’d leave the building each morning and enjoy the sunrise
    like it was the last one I’d ever see; I’d push myself on the erg knowing I
    wouldn’t want my last session to be a disappointment (last one, fast one!);
    I’d relish the feeling of exhaustion that would overtake me as I collapsed
    on my hastily abandoned bed, at which point, I’d ask myself if I would show
    up again tomorrow. I wouldn’t, or couldn’t, give myself an answer until
    later that night, at which point I’d look back at the previous morning and
    decide if I wanted to give my love to rowing one more time. Some nights, I
    choose not to and enjoyed the next day as I had any other, more often than
    not, I found myself waking up at 5am once more, running to grab my bike and
    fight for an erg in that cramped and damp hallway.

    After a while, once some months had gone by and spring approached again, the
    river unfroze and our club returned to the water, and my love for the sport
    emerged out, back from it’s hibernation. Just like that, I was back on my
    bike, watching watching breathtaking sunsets, and pushing myself for not
    reason other than to know I wouldn’t have regrets if I never touched a boat
    again. So, why was I rowing this morning? Because when I went to bed last
    night, I asked myself a question and knew I wanted to.

    I’ve learned that burnout isn’t a lack of motivation, it’s what happens when
    you stop seeing why you enjoy giving your love; It’s hard to deal with.
    Sometimes, the best thing you can do is step away, even when you want
    nothing more than to hold it tight to your chest. But we can’t love
    something because we are afraid to lose it, and by stepping away and giving
    ourselves space to remember how it fits into our lives, we can let go of our
    fear and love for love’s sake. To give love is no small thing, but it is
    also a great and rare treasure that enriches our lives when allowed to
    properly bloom. I’ve been lucky to find love in rowing, in piano, and in
    those special people who have come through my life, and while I’d like to
    say I’ve lived a life of no regrets, that’s unfortunately not true— I’ve had
    loves I wish I’d given more to; Of those, I carry their regrets with me, but
    for the loves I gave and didn’t receive back? Of those, I carry with me the
    memory of the simple joy of loving.

    I still don’t know how to give unconditional love. I still struggle to take
    that first step, to give my love without fearing disappointment in not
    receiving any back. But each day I do take that step, but it with a partner,
    a hobby, or with a compliment to a stranger, I learn to fear my love as
    little less. It’s a slow process, but every step I take is one towards the
    live I want to build.
