        "blurb": "<p>A long time ago in a high school far, far away, I watched a Casey Neistat video about how he made his iconic sunglasses. Now for the record, I’ve never been a big Casey Neistat fan— in fact this was probably the 2nd and last video of his I ever watched. Despite that, this video has stuck with me throughout the years because of a profoundness in it that jumped out at me but I couldn’t quite place a finger on. His glasses were just a regular pair of black sunglasses, like you’d find at any corner store or Sunglasses Hut alike, but what made them unique was how he’d modified them. In the video, he explained the process as we watched him, in real time, as he took an Exacto-knife to the frames and chipped away at the paint, leaving behind an intricate yet simple black-and-white pattern. I still remember how he moved the blade, an expert not in the skill it took but in his confidence to do it, and transformed the glasses’ black matte finish in an intricate and hypnotic pattern. The sunglasses were always “cool” in some unexplainable way, and while you could easily point to the pattern as the reason why, that video made me think that the coolness of the glasses goes much deeper than just the visual detail. The pattern isn’t a specific design, it’s not even delicate, intricate, or planned out— it was simply the vision of one man, letting his mind freely guide his hand and implant a piece of himself into those frames; In doing so, the glasses were changed from a simple store-bought pair into <em>his</em> glasses— they contained a piece of him.</p>",

        "date": "Aug 24th, 2025",
        "blurb": "<p> Burnout is something I’ve been dealing with my whole life, so the most frustrating part of my current mood is the fact I didn’t see it coming. That is to say I am, unfortunately and predictably, burnt out. It’s not the first time that it’s happened, so while I’m struggling to find the motivation to write about anything, I thought I’d simply tell you about my <em>past</em> experiences with motivation and a lack thereof. </p> <p> As those close to me are <em>well </em>aware of, I am a competitive rower for my university team. I first joined the team as part of their novice program in September of last year and, despite never having rowed before, found myself falling in love with the sport— from the fitness, to the teambuilding and friendship, to the competitive nature of the sport, there is a lot of fun to be found in rowing. But with as much potential rowing has, it also requires an equal (and sometimes greater) amount of sacrifice to support the lifestyle it requires. Waking up at 4:30am requires either strict bedtimes or a tolerance for being sleep-deprived most days, and the 2 hours of daily cardio turns your normal energy levels into a status bar that is never quite full. However, despite the total shift in what my life looked like, I ran through those first 2 months like I’ve never ran before. It was crazy, it was amazing, and most of all, it was one of the best parts of my university experience. However, when the calendar hit November, the season ended, and we transitioned to off-water training on the ergs, my once blooming passion for the sport just… died. </p>",

        "blurb": "<p> I have, undeniably, changed as a person throughout the course of my life. If you were to pick some arbitrary point in my life and compared who I was then with who I am now, you would find a difference, no matter how small, between those two people. However, for as much as I’ve obsessed over my personal growth these past 5 years (and I have obsessed…), I still have a hard time pinning down exactly what this difference <em>is</em>— it’s there, absolutely, but what has actually, <em>really changed</em>? </p> <p> As much as I can see this apparent difference between my past and present self, when intentionally looking for it, I find I struggle to actually <em>feel</em> this difference in my day-to-day life. Because for as much as I have changed as a person, I can feel the person I used to be still living within me. All the fears and anxieties that ruled over past me are still there today, however diminished and regulated, and still dictate my actions like they did in the past. In fact, one of the most significant things I’ve taken away from my therapy sessions is learning to accept that my trauma, and the effects of it on my mind, will always be a part of me. As well, the other parts of me that have changed— my sense of humour, my values, my physical body— all still come from the same source within me as they used to, now just reflected in different ways and through new mediums. Sure, these things have <em>changed</em>, but the ghosts of what they once were still exist somewhere inside of me. So when searching for this mystical <em>difference</em>, where is it to be found? </p>",

        "date": "Aug 10th, 2025",
        "blurb": "<p> In the hundreds of millions of books that have been written, there are very few that shape the world around them. These influential books, such as Karl Marx’s <em>Capital</em> or Ayn Rand’s <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>(while <strong>vastly</strong ><em><strong> </strong></em>different in their messaging), have shaped the culture we live in to the extent their previously monstrous insights almost seem obvious to us today. However, these works have enjoyed the privilege of time, which has allowed them to become part of our collective unconscious— a privilege <em>All About Love </em>has not had. And yet, after reading hooks’ work, it is now impossible not to see it bleeding into the culture we live in. In a world full of pessimism, cynicism, and a feeling of hopelessness against forces greater than ourselves, hooks can just be found, in small pockets we stumble across if our eyes are keen enough to see them. The urging to embrace an unrestricted form of love for our fellow people, the cries for more community, and the wanting to find and give love to the world around us— These videos and articles we watch and read are hooks speaking to us, her ink seeping into the world around us through hopecore edits and unfettered statements of love. <em>All About Love</em> is one of those few books mentioned before, and after reading it, I look forward to seeing a world where it is placed among the very best. </p>",
