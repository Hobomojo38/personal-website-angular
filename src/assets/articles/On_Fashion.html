    A long time ago in a high school far, far away, I watched a Casey Neistat
    video about how he made his iconic sunglasses. Now for the record, I’ve
    never been a big Casey Neistat fan— in fact this was probably the 2nd and
    last video of his I ever watched. Despite that, this video has stuck with me
    throughout the years because of a profoundness in it that jumped out at me
    but I couldn’t quite place a finger on. His glasses were just a regular pair
    of black sunglasses, like you’d find at any corner store or Sunglasses Hut
    alike, but what made them unique was how he’d modified them. In the video,
    he explained the process as we watched him, in real time, as he spraypainted
    the frames white and then chipped away at the paint, leaving behind an
    intricate yet simple black-and-white pattern. I still remember how he
    handled the paint, an expert not in the skill it took but in his confidence
    to do it, and transformed the glasses’ black matte finish in an intricate
    and hypnotic pattern. The sunglasses were always “cool” in some
    unexplainable way, and while you could easily point to the pattern as the
    reason why, that video made me think that the coolness of the glasses goes
    much deeper than just the visual detail. The pattern isn’t a specific
    design, it’s not even delicate, intricate, or planned out— it was simply the
    vision of one man, letting his mind freely guide his hand and implant a
    piece of himself into those frames; In doing so, the glasses were changed
    from a simple store-bought pair into
    <em>his</em> glasses— they contained a piece of him.

    Soon after watching that video, I hit a point in my life that I started to
    care about how I looked. I think everyone hits that point sooner or later,
    and to greater or lesser extents, but for me, it started around 10th grade
    and I’ve only grown to care more since then (to a more or less of a degree).
    I, of course, started by punching “how to dress well” into Google, and the
    all-too-common advice I found was to “find someone who you like and copy
    their style”. In hindsight, I think this is really solid advice for the most
    part! Taking this advice and putting some thought into it, 2 people jumped
    out at me that I really liked at the time: Asahi from the anime
    <em>Haikyuu</em>, and Iron Man from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Inspired by
    those two, I grew my hair out and started putting it in a bun like Asahi,
    and started to wear some long-sleeved shirts (as Tony Stark often does) as
    well as some larger flannel shirts (another one of the Reddit tips I found).
    I did end up creating a “look” after I finished that I really enjoyed, and
    it’s a look that came to dominate my wardrobe for a while and still bears
    it’s mark in my closet even after all these years. However, after a while of
    experimenting and growing and changing my look into what it is today, I’ve
    always had a question poking out in the back of my mind: why did I choose
    <em>those</em> people? There are plenty I could have picked from, people and
    characters I admire and find fashionable, but why did I gravitate towards
    <em>them</em>? What about their look made me not just appreciate it, but
    want to <em>become it</em>?
  </p>
  <p id="27a6324d-6e81-801d-93cb-e091af1f3702" class="">
    I don’t think it was just their looks and style that drew me towards them,
    but more so the characters themselves that I found so magnetic. Asahi, the
    “Ace of Karasuno”, was a strong backbone to the show’s volleyball team and
    he reflected that in how he looked— He was physically large and could be
    relied on no matter the situation, and yet still had a heart of gold. To me,
    he was a symbol of someone who could be relied on by those around him
    without needing to lose himself in his dedication. Tony Stark is a man
    defined by his struggles, from the PTSD he carries with him to the
    unbearable weight of decisions that always seemed to fall on his shoulders.
    And yet, he rises to the challenge in spite of his fear, embodying the
    question “Is the man who does not struggle to do good better than the man
    who struggles but manages to do good anyway?” For me, the charm and appeal
    of these characters, more than any others I knew, was that they represented
    the values that I wished I myself embodied. It’s no coincidence that both of
    them are fictional characters, because characters in a story are made to
    represent ideals and virtues. I saw myself, and who I wanted to be, within
    these people— I didn’t just want to dress or look like them, I wanted to
    <em>be them</em>. It wasn’t the clothes or the fashion that was appealing,
    it was the <em>people inside of it</em> that made them stand out. The way my
    heroes were dressed and portrayed is an extension of the values they
    represented. The traits they embodied were represented in the clothes they
    wore, and the clothes they wore were picked <em>because</em> they embodied
    the traits of the characters— In dressing like Asahi and Tony Stark, I
    started to embody those traits as well. The clothes I wore represented the
    virtues I held, and in doing so, made me successfully start to participate
    in the act of fashion: I was expressing myself!

    However, (and don’t tell this to younger me, please) to say I was
    “fashionable” would be an overstatement. My clothes didn’t fit me all that
    well and I wasn’t taking that great physical care of myself either, so I
    looked less like my heroes and more like… well, a teenager trying to look
    like Tony Stark with a man-bun. But where exactly did I fail in being
    fashionable? After all, fashion is about self-expression, so by dressing
    with the clothes that represented who I was and wanted to be, why wasn’t I
    being fashionable? I think the key to answering that, and what younger me
    didn’t realize, was that fashion does not exist in isolation. Fashion, like
    all of the arts and culture, is a form of communication and as such, only
    has meaning as agreed upon by everyone who participates in it. So while I
    was expressing myself, I failed to grasp the “message” that my clothing was
    communicating. I wasn’t displaying the values of perseverance and stoicism
    that I thought I was… I was displaying that I was a Marvel fan who also
    watched anime. If fashion is a form of communication, then I wasn’t
    fashionable because I didn’t yet know how to “speak” in the language of
    fashion. But how can you learn this? How do you learn not just how to be
    fashionable, but how to
    <em>participate in culture as a whole</em>?
  </p>
  <p id="27a6324d-6e81-80b5-b237-c0ba0e899662" class="">
    To say “Fashion doesn’t exist in isolation” would not be incorrect, but it’s
    also not that useful either for exploring how fashion
    <em>does</em> exist. It’s more accurate to say that fashion exists
    <em>in relation</em> to the world around it, and even more accurate to
    describe it as a <em>dialectic process</em>. A term first popularized by
    Hegel and later adopted by Karl Marx, the dialectic is the idea that an
    object, and its meaning, is defined only in relation to other objects (The
    words “dialectic” and “dialogue” both stem from the same origin. Another way
    to explain it is the “definition” of an object comes from it existing in a
    dialogue with other objects). This is how objects, ideas, theories, and
    cultures, are assigned “values” that aren’t inherent to the physical objects
    themselves— everything exists <em>in relation</em> to the world around it
    and that relation defines what something is, not the object itself. Over
    time, as we learn more about how to object interacts with the world, we gain
    a greater insight into that specific object. A jacket on it’s own is simply
    a jacket, but as we learn about leather jackets, jean jackets, and winter
    jackets and parkas, we can understand better what exactly our jacket is and
    what values it represents. This is how we learn through the dialectic
    process as well— our understanding of something specific is a result of
    studying how it relates to everything else. This is why every school class
    covers the <em>history</em> of a subject before teaching it (or at least,
    should), because the context in which an event, idea, or object exists
    <em>is part</em> of the object itself— removing it from that context
    divorces the object from an essential part of its meaning!
  </p>
  <p id="27a6324d-6e81-8097-9dda-c643f607d619" class="">
    This also applies at a much higher level, with the dialectic process even
    occurring over the course of millennia and shaping our political thought.
    The kings and tyrants of the medieval ages gave way to the Renaissance and
    the Age of Enlightenment with its preaching of personal liberty, capitalism,
    and democracy, and the controversial and unnecessary Vietnam war was
    countered by the Hippie movement in the 1960’s. Our culture, at anytime in
    history, is a response to whatever the previous moment’s ideas and events
    were. This includes fashion, with the clothing of a certain era representing
    the ideas, materials, and values that the era carried. Long, flowing skirts
    will always be associated with the hippie culture of the 60’s and the values
    they carried, and suits will always be associated with wealth, status, and
    masculinity. All of our clothes, from our shirts to our shoes, our jackets,
    and our necklaces or lack-there-of, have a set of values associated with
    them. This is most commonly seen and quantified in the current trend of
    “aesthetics” on social media, with groups of books, keychains, wallpapers,
    and clothing coming together to represent a specific character and
    stereotype— one we all recognize even when they don’t carry a specific face.
    Every item of clothing represents a group of social values, and as aspiring
    self-expressers we must first learn to see and identify exactly
    <em>what</em> values an item carries and <em>then </em>decide if it fits
    with our self-image.
  </p>
  <p id="27a6324d-6e81-80ae-b6dc-d429905a8ed6" class="">
    I think that last point is an important one that often goes understated when
    talking about fashion, and is why I specifically brought dialectics into
    this conversation. Like a good every dialogue, the cultural dialectic
    requires <em>two</em> objects to be in communication. Culture is such a
    unique entity because it is not a single object or person— it is the entire
    world we live in outside of ourselves. And so to understand culture, we must
    compare it to something that it is not: <em>ourselves</em>. And in turn, to
    understand ourselves is to understand how we exist in relation to the world
    around us— our culture. This is the crux of culture, the fact that
    understanding and exploring culture is also the act of understanding and
    exploring <em>ourselves</em>.

  <p id="27a6324d-6e81-806b-9850-c56f48c434c1" class="">
    As individuals learning to understand fashion (undergoing the dialectic
    process), we are in fact learning to understand ourselves and how we exist
    in relation to the world around us. This is <em>why</em> fashion is so tied
    to self-expression, because it is a direct dialogue between ourselves and
    the culture around us. We will dress in a certain way for a while, the whole
    time learning more about culture and ourselves until we eventually reach a
    point where we start to see a conflict between our own self-image and the
    cultural-image our look gives off. When this point is reached, we will
    correct ourselves, looking for something else that better matches our newly
    redefined self. We’ve all worn the shirts of bands we barely knew because we
    thought the <em>cultural-image</em> of what that shirt represented aligned
    with who we where, only to drop it from our rotation months later when we
    learned that “AC/DC” wasn’t exactly the embodiment of what we wanted to be
    (Still a great band though, bangers all around). As individuals, we see and
    interact with all of our culture’s trends and aesthetics, pushing and
    pulling against them until we find our relation to each, learning more about
    ourselves with each experience.

    <em>Good</em> fashion isn’t defined by how mainstream and trendy your
    clothing is, nor how expensive and rich you look— it’s about how well you
    participate in the <em>act</em> of fashion. Good fashion expresses not just
    who you are, but who you are <em>in relation</em> to the world around you.
    Being dressed in the latest trends does not make you fashionable, it only
    shows that you know what the latest trends are— in fact, if the values
    associated with those trendy clothes do not match your own, then you are in
    fact doing <em>bad</em> fashion and being manipulative (For everyone who’s
    being thinking about “performative males” lately, there’s a great place to
    start). Being fashionable requires knowing what is trending, what those
    trends represent, and then dressing yourself in relation to them. If you
    like the mainstream trends, then shop at the trendy stores and throw in a
    splash of your tastes; If you hate the mainstream fashion, politics, or
    general trends, then join the Alt-scene and dress in opposition to the
    current trends. As long as you display an understanding of both yourself and
    the wider culture, then you are doing <em>good fashion</em>. But even if we
    understand ourselves and the world we live in, how can that guide the
    choices we make? How do we take our knowledge, walk into a store, and out of
    the thousands of options presented to us, pick the right item to be
    fashionable?
  </p>
  <p id="27a6324d-6e81-8096-9cea-d78d30d5b678" class="">
    The answer to that is deceptively simple, and is why I praised the advice I
    first encountered when I started my journey:
    <em>pick what you like</em>. The clothes and accessories we wear all have
    more meanings and associations to them than can ever be explained or written
    down, but that’s where our <em>intuition</em> comes in. Our understanding of
    our culture can give us a description of the meanings an item has, and our
    understanding of ourselves tells us what description best aligns with who we
    are, with all of this manifesting as a <em>feeling</em> through our
    intuition. This 6th-sense can be trained through practice and we can learn
    to listen to it when we want to. For example, I’ve always liked running
    shoes, and while there are much more “fashionable” shoes out there, I’ve
    learned that I value function over form, and that expresses itself through
    the fact I prefer running shoes over other types of shoes because they
    adequately represent where I stand on the scale between work boots and high
    heels. In wearing those shoes, I feel good representing who I am— there’s
    much more “fashionable” shoes to be worn, and I do see and admire other
    people strutting their stuff in them, but the fact I don’t care to buy a
    pair of Air Jordans <em>is itself a statement</em> of my inner values. For
    that statement to be intentional requires me to understand what Air Jordans
    represent and how my shoes stand in relation to that, but I wasn’t thinking
    of all that when I bought them— I just <em>liked</em> the shoes and trusted
    my intuition, and in doing so, allowed my natural understanding of myself
    and the shoe market to guide me. I may be wrong, and most likely am about
    both what the shoes represent and where I myself stand on the scale, but I
    can only learn and correct this by participating in the dialogue— by wearing
    the shoes that I like. It is only by practicing my intuition that I am able
    to expand it and come to better understand who I am. No amount of research
    and reddit threads can grow my intuition in the same way experience can.

    It’s been years since I watched that Casey Neistat video, and only now do I
    think I understand why it’s stuck with all this time. It’s that specific
    image that’s burned into my mind, of Casey’s hand carving those sunglasses
    without a sign of hesitancy or doubt. He let his intuition guide his hand,
    taking him not where he thought he should go but where he <em>felt</em> he
    wanted to be, and in doing so, captured a perfect example of what it means
    to do fashion. As I swapped and dropped pieces in and out of my wardrobe
    over the years, I always had this idea that fashion was something
    <em>over there</em>, with the runways and the models and the expensive price
    tags that were so far removed from my small world. I always felt like I was
    stumbling blind in a room others could sprint in, but I’ve realized now that
    I was doing exactly what I should’ve been: learning. Not just about fashion
    like I was trying to, but about myself as well. Over time, I learned what I
    did and didn’t like and grew the courage to trust myself and let my
    intuition to guide me to where I would needed to be. I know I’ll change
    again as time goes on, and the outfits I love oh-so-much right now will be
    old and outdated eventually, but the reason for that change will be because
    I learned <em>better</em>. So when the day comes that I toss away my last
    long-sleeved shirt and well-worn flannel, it will not be a funeral. Instead,
    it will be a celebration of how far I’ve come in learning about myself and
    the world around me— and you’re more than welcome to join the party, my
    friends!
