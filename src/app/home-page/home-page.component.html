                    I started studying computer science at uOttawa in 2021, and since then, I’ve worked for ESDC and uOttawa Engineering Outreach in co-op positions. These positions gave me great experience working with both SAP and Full-stack development respectively. On top of this, I also create projects on the side, the details of which I provide on this website! 
                    <br><br> I first learned how to code in high school through a programming course in Gr. 10, during which my friends and I would play “Clash of Code” (Shout-out CodinGame!) to try a brush-up our skills. The next thing I knew, I was applying to Computer Science programs at universities, and I got in! I haven’t had as much time for projects lately, but I’m always plugging away at a file in VSCode whenever I have downtime.

                    Along with programming, music has always been a passion of mine since I was little. Because of this, I’m also pursuing being an amateur musician, with more of an emphasis on “amateur” than “musician”. I’ve been playing piano for 6 years now, guitar for 2 years, and drums for 8 years (Though I haven’t really played since I started university). The only lessons I’ve taken have been in drumming, with piano and guitar both being self-taught! I also have experience with recording and producing songs, all of which can be found on my Soundcloud (with some videos on YouTube).
                    <br><br> I’m also an actor, having acted in 4 musicals during high school and 2 stage productions through the UOTC at uOttawa, Midsummer and Footloose: The Musical!
